#Airport Management System

This was created as part of our Software Engineering Project where we use Agile methodologies as part of the creation of this airport management system. It is a web based application where passengers would be able to check status of their flights, checkin and also shop in the airport through this system. Admins will have an overall control of the schedules of the flights and any changes that needs to be done. We have also incorporated a NLP based voice api where passengers can speak and search for their flight rather than typing it out. We have performed unit testing, functional testing and static code analysis to analyse the performance of the application.
